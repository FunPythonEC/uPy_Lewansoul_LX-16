# uPy_Lewansoul_LX-16
This is a library specific to be used in MicroPython, especifically for the ESP32 and ESP8266. However, it should work in any other board with uPy that has uart ports.

This uPy script will be developed with the help of the following repository: https://github.com/maximkulkin/lewansoul-lx16a

I will only be adapting any function and constructors needed for a better use, similar to the Dynamixel library used by Robotis.
